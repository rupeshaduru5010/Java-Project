# Java-Project
-> This project is about "how is my understanding in core java".
-> I am going to put all the code files from scratch.(Starting with "Hello World")
-> In this repo i am going to commit the code files according to the topic we normally learn while learning core java.
-> I would love to see if there is a more creative way to write the code.
